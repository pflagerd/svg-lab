I want a web application built which I will fiddle with and maintain.
I want it to be a kind of svg laboratory where I can fiddle with bits of svg code and see the results rendered.
I want it to be a standalone web application with no server io.
I want the svg editor on the left side of the window and the viewer on the left.
I want it to work similar to jsfiddle, but be only concerned with a chunk of svg code.
I want it to use CodeMirror for syntax highlighting in the editor.
I want preset templates.
I do not want a run button.  I want auto-update.
I want a File Menu, with Save As and an Open as its two options.
Both should use the Google Chrome file api.
I want autosave and drag-drop file import.
I want the filename to which the most save was made centered between the File menu and the Template.
I want Ctrl-S to be intercepted as a shortcut for 1) save if a file is already opened, 2) Save as if the file has not been saved yet.
I want the File menu left-justified, the Template right-justified and the filename centered between them.
Please generate the complete code after having presented the individual changes from now on.
I want the preview to be zoomable/resizable.
The implementation has somehow got the File menu, the filename and the template on the preview window as well as the editor window.  I only want it on the the editor window.
I'd like mousewheel zoom for the preview
I'd like a resizable split pane between editor/preview
I want Mousewheel zoom, with or without Ctrl.
I want panning/dragging of the zoomed SVG.
I want the zoom centered at the mouse position, instead of being relative to upper left corner.
I'd like a "zoom to fit" button.
Also, when I use the zoom buttons after using the mousewheel, the image "jumps".  Kind of like the zoom buttons don't respect the last mouse position used to zoom.
Zoom is still not quite right.  Still not computing correct scaled panned origin?
