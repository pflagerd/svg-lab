I want a web application built which I will fiddle with and maintain.
I want it to be a kind of svg laboratory where I can fiddle with bits of svg code and see the results rendered.
I want it to be a standalone web application with no server io.
I want the svg editor on the left side of the window and the viewer on the left.
I want it to work similar to jsfiddle, but be only concerned with a chunk of svg code.
I want it to use CodeMirror for syntax highlighting in the editor.
I want preset templates.
I do not want a run button.  I want auto-update.
I want a File Menu, with Save As and an Open as its two options.
Both should use the Google Chrome file api.
I want autosave and drag-drop file import.
I want the filename to which the most save was made centered between the File menu and the Template.
I want Ctrl-S to be intercepted as a shortcut for 1) save if a file is already opened, 2) Save as if the file has not been saved yet.
I want the File menu left-justified, the Template right-justified and the filename centered between them.
Please generate the complete code after having presented the individual changes from now on.
I want the preview to be zoomable/resizable.
The implementation has somehow got the File menu, the filename and the template on the preview window as well as the editor window.  I only want it on the the editor window.
I'd like mousewheel zoom for the preview
I'd like a resizable split pane between editor/preview
